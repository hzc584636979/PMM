					<p>In 536, the star class battleship of the infinite deep space, affiliated to the earth international, went to outer space to carry out missions. The engine of the battleship broke down, and the battleship could not slow down to turn and return to the earth. In a long time, the infinite deep space will be sailing at 1 / 100 of the speed of light towards the Dark Universe. </p>
					<p>In order to return to the solar system, the crew must repair the engine, but the engine is seriously damaged. According to calculation, at the current speed, after repairing the engine, the remaining fuel in the spacecraft is not enough to support the process of deceleration, turning, acceleration and deceleration. </p>
					<p>Even if the fuel is mainly used in the two deceleration stages, it is not feasible to supply the minimum fuel in the acceleration stage. According to the calculation, if the fuel for the two decelerations is removed, the remaining fuel can only accelerate the spacecraft to 1 / 10000 of the speed of light. It is almost impossible to return to the solar system at such a speed, because the hibernation and ecological maintenance system of warships cannot last for such a long time 。 </p>
					<p>Finally, after the vote of all the crew, they decided to give up the decision to repair the existing engine, and put the resources into the research and development of the new starship engine. </p>
					<p>However, there are quite different opinions on the research direction of new engines on warships. Some warships tend to develop the research direction towards the electromagnetic drive engine or neutrino engine with certain theoretical basis, and some extreme warships suggest to develop the research direction towards the curvature drive engine or infinite non probability engine without definite feasibility. </p>
					<p>Such differences eventually led to warships have to develop research in several directions at the same time, but warships have limited resources, so that research in each direction is not smooth. </p>

					<p style={{textIndent: '2em'}}> happy! We have the same hobbies and ideals, a group of deep net geeks with wisdom and technology, we give up the unfair rules. Based on the condition triggering and command execution of smart contract, all troublemakers have no chance to cheat. It is fair, open, transparent, safe and tamper proof, which is more suitable for Ethereum's ecological environment. In order to help Ethereum community consensus, Ethereum Park was born. </p>
					<p style={{textIndent: '2em'}}> now the consensus economy is in a state of barbarism and chaos, and non consensus autonomy is the main reason for the unfair rules. So that participants can not protect their rights and interests, a large number of participants because of loss, but to quit the industry. Therefore, inspired by the PMM (perpetual motion machine), the first ecological PMC application of ethereumpark layout is born from this. The purpose of PMC is to create a living consensus economy DAPP. </p>
					<p style={{textIndent: '2em'}}> pmc5 day cycle, the design of reverse revenue reflects a fair and win-win situation, making Ethereum ecology more cohesive! We want to do a great thing! Let smart contracts really provide the impetus for the sustainable and sound development of the confused consensus economy. </p>
